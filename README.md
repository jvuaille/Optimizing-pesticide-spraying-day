# Optimizing-pesticide-spraying-day
Code and data for the study entitled "Can information on past and near-future weather and field conditions predict the safest pesticide application day?"
Vuaille, Holbak, Perslev, Diamantopoulos, Jensen, Styczen, Petersen, Strobel, Abrahamsen (2022, submitted to Journal of Environmental Management). University of Copenhagen.

Includes the Daisy setup files for simulating pesticide leaching to drains at Rørrendegård and the RNN meta-models trained on simulated data.
Input features of the RNN meta-models: see Table of Features in the manuscript.
The input features need to be standardized.
